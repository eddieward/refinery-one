Allows you to associate roles with users and pages.  Assigning a role to a page means only users with that role will be able to see it.


User roles are currently assignable via the user admin pages, but I wanted a simpler way to do it.


Still needed:
*  Proper 403 page.  Right now, it 404's which is not correct.
*  Members list based on a given role
*  Roles management page
*  Add :title to the User model so the engine will always use title
*  Expand to other models


Check it out, use it, hack it and contribute back.
